# Changelog

All notable changes to the `caleb-collar/openpilot` **r1t-xnor-adventure** fork are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Fork versions are tagged `r1t-vX.Y.Z` and are independent of the upstream sunnypilot version
(`openpilot/sunnypilot/common/version.h`).

> The root `CHANGELOG.md` is upstream sunnypilot's changelog. The device parses it at runtime
> for release notes, so this fork leaves it unchanged.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Fork infrastructure on top of `xnor-tech/openpilot` `rx-dev` prebuilt `8a627abb0`:
  fork README, this changelog, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the integration plan (`INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, revision 2).
- Conventional Commits enforcement: `.githooks/commit-msg` hook (enable with
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) and a GitHub Actions commit-lint job.
- GitHub Actions `fork-ci` workflow: commit lint, and `py_compile` + `ruff` on fork-touched Python files.
- Sudo-free fork tooling in `fork/` (see `fork/README.md`). All tools come from hash-locked wheels in the upstream `uv.lock` files:
  - `safety_tests.sh`: panda safety gate (all safety-mode tests, 100% line coverage, MISRA C:2012, mutation testing).
  - `build_firmware.sh` + `fw_compare.py`: build panda firmware from any ref in an isolated worktree with the pinned
    Arm GNU Toolchain 13.2.rel1, and verify committed firmware matches committed sources (byte-identical modulo gitversion).
  - `check_invariants.sh`: enforces the prebuilt-branch rules (no param-key/capnp/native changes, upstream changelogs
    untouched, installer requirements, xnor angle-stack files unchanged).
- CI jobs `invariants`, `safety`, and `firmware` (strict on `r1t-dev`, `r1t-xnor-adventure`, sync branches, and PRs;
  uploads firmware images and `SHA256SUMS` as artifacts).
